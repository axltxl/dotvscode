# Painpoints
* `vscode-which-key` would be actually nice
* Keyboard bindings for easily switching vscode windows
* Keyboard bindings for common git operations (checkout, fetch, push)
* As of the time of writing, is there something like `magit` but for vscode?
* Keyboard binding for focusing on side panel
